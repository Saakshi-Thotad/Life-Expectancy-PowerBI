# Life-Expectancy-PowerBI
A Power BI project performing analysis on life expectancy(WHO) data, exploring global health factors, disease patterns, and and future forecasts.

This repository hosts a comprehensive and interactive Power BI dashboard designed to analyze global life expectancy trends and key public health determinants.

1. Project Overview:
* The dashboard was developed to explore historical data, identify influencing factors, and predict future trends in life expectancy and disease prevalence worldwide. It provides a multi-faceted view of global health, integrating demographic, socio-economic, and disease-specific indicators.

2. Dataset
* Source:https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/kumarajarshi/life-expectancy-who
* Name:"Life expectancy data(WHO)"
* Description:The dataset contains various health and socio-economic factors for numerous countries over several years, crucial for understanding global health outcomes.

3. Key Features of the Dashboard
* The Power BI report is structured into four interactive pages, each designed to provide specific insights:
    
    Country Health Overview:
* Presents an executive summary with key performance indicators (KPIs) for life expectancy, GDP, schooling, and population.
* Includes geographical analysis (filled maps) and country-level comparisons.
* Provides a snapshot of average disease burdens (HIV, Diphtheria, Hepatitis, Measles, Polio) for selected periods.

  Disease Trends and Forecasts:
* Visualizes historical trends for individual disease rates and mortality (Adult Mortality, Infant Deaths).
* Includes 5-year forecasts for disease rates and mortality, providing future outlooks.

  Life Expectancy Drivers:
* Explores dynamic correlations between life expectancy and key socio-economic and health factors (e.g., Schooling, BMI, Thinness) using interactive scatter plots with a play-axis for time-based analysis.    
* Features a dedicated trend analysis and 5-year forecast for life expectancy.

  GDP and Expenditure Impact:
* Analyzes the direct influence of economic factors (GDP, Percentage Expenditure, Income Composition of Resources) on life expectancy and health outcomes.
* Provides insights into global health investment and development.

4. Technical Aspects & Skills Demonstrated

* Tool: Power BI Desktop
* Data Preparation: Involved extensive data transformation, cleaning, and dealing with missing values and errors to ensure data integrity.
* DAX Language: Leveraged DAX language to develop advanced measures and calculated columns for complex calculations and aggregations.
* Data Visualization: Utilized a diverse range of Power BI visuals, including cards, filled maps, clustered bar charts, multi-row cards, line charts, combo charts (dual-axis), and scatter plots with play-axis animations.
* Interactivity: Enhanced user experience through **multi-select and hierarchical slicers**, enabling dynamic data exploration and drilling down into specific countries and statuses.
* Forecasting: Applied Power BI's built-in forecasting capabilities to **predict life expectancy and disease rates for forthcoming years**.
* Dashboard Design: Focused on intuitive navigation, consistent thematic formatting, and clear data storytelling across all four pages.
